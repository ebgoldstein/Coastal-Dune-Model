#Coastal Dune Model with Lateral vegetation growth

This is a new version of the 'Coastal Dune Model' (CDM) with a vegetation subroutine that computes lateral expansion of vegetation. This version of the model was used in Goldstein et al. (2017). http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/esurf-2017-2

The model in this repository is based on the model described in Moore et al. (2016): http://dx.doi.org/10.1130/G37778.1

The original CDM was first described in Durán and Moore (2013). http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1307580110
The code for the original Durán and Moore (2013) paper is avalable here: https://github.com/csdms-contrib/Coastal-Dune-Model and has a doi (http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16161).
